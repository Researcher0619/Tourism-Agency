## Java, Java Swing

The working logic of a tourism agency is as follows: Hotels reserve specific rooms for the Patika Tourism Agency and wait for the agency to sell these rooms. The agency, when selling these rooms, adds its service fee on top, either as a percentage or a fixed amount, and sells them to customers.

The agency believes that handling these tasks on paper and manually is a waste of time and seeks a software solution to streamline its operations.

### Agency's Expectations from the Software:

#### Hotel Management
The agency should be able to manage hotels with their location information and other details within the system. When adding a hotel, various parameters such as Hotel Name, Address, Email, Phone, Stars, Facility Features, and Board Types are defined.

Historical periods for hotels are added, and pricing is determined based on these periods. The goal here is to provide variable pricing. For instance, hotel prices are higher during summer months compared to lower rates in winter. Pricing in the tourism sector is done seasonally. Seasons are defined as date ranges.
